    # Clients must be actively connected to the OpenTok session for you to successfully start
    # recording an archive.
    #
    # You can only record one archive at a time for a given session. You can only record archives
    # of sessions that use the OpenTok Media Router (sessions with the media mode set to routed);
    # you cannot archive sessions with the media mode set to relayed.

    #   and 'output_mode'.
    # @option options [String] :name This is the name of the archive. You can use this name
    #   to identify the archive. It is a property of the Archive object, and it is a property
    #   of archive-related events in the OpenTok client SDKs.
    # @option options [true, false] :has_audio Whether the archive will include an audio track
    #   (<code>true</code>) or not <code>false</code>). The default value is <code>true</code>
    #   (an audio track is included). If you set both  <code>has_audio</code> and
    #   <code>has_video</code> to <code>false</code>, the call to the <code>create()</code>
    #   method results in an error.
    # @option options [true, false] :has_video Whether the archive will include a video track
    #   (<code>true</code>) or not <code>false</code>). The default value is <code>true</code>
    #   (a video track is included). If you set both  <code>has_audio</code> and
    #   <code>has_video</code> to <code>false</code>, the call to the <code>create()</code>
    #   method results in an error.
    # @option options [String] :output_mode Whether all streams in the archive are recorded
    #     to a single file (<code>:composed</code>, the default) or to individual files
    #     (<code>:individual</code>). For more information on archiving and the archive file
    #     formats, see the {https://tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/archiving OpenTok archiving}
    #     programming guide.
    # @option options [String] :resolution The resolution of the archive, either "640x480" (SD, the
    #   default) or "1280x720" (HD). This property only applies to composed archives. If you set
    #   this property and set the outputMode property to "individual", the call the method
    #   results in an error.
